About me
--------
One of the books that motivated me to construct this site, nedlaw.eu, is entitled "The question of world order - Henry Kissinger". 
Written by the former Secretary of State and scholar, the book is divided to nine segments.

1. Europe the pluralistic international order
2. European balance of power and its end
3. Islam and Middle-East: a world in disorder
4. The United States and Iran: approaches to order
5. The multiplicity of Asia
6. Towards an Asian order: confrontation on partnership
7. "Acting for all mankind": the United States and its concept of order
8. The United States: ambivalent superpower
9. Technology, equilibrium, and human consciousness.

In doing so, the index substitutes a filter to categorize topics both regionally and by substance.

As for myself, I would like to think that I am open-minded and at times carefree individual.
I also am a programmer.
I do play golf, snowboard, ski, swim, and travel. 
At times I take myself time to read a hard-cover book. 
And I do like sudo-anonymity (hiding in plain sight). 

The decision to constructing the site are likely based on the Brexit vote and the 2016 US. Presidential elections.
To me those events are effects of causality.
Thus, there is a bigger picture to link the two effects into causes.

Nash Equilibrium - game theory

- http://www.columbia.edu/~rs328/NashEquilibrium.pdf

	Nash Equilibrium and Dominant Strategies

	Nash Equilibrium is a term used in game theory to describe an equilibrium where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of all other players. A Nash Equilibrium exists when there is no unilateral profitable deviation from any of the players involved. In other words, no player in the game would take a different action as long as every other player remains the same. Nash Equilibria are self-enforcing; when players are at a Nash Equilibrium they have no desire to move because they will be worse off. 
	
time 

- https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/the-flow-of-time-in-a-timeless-universe/

"Time no longer appears to us as a gigantic, world-dominating chronos, nor as a primitive entity, but as something derived from phenomena themselves. It is a 	figment of my thinking.” Schrödinger, Erwin.

	Does time flow or is it static and discrete?

Homeostatic control

	To maintain homeostasis, communication within the body is essential. The image below is an example of how a homeostatic control system works. Here is a brief explanation:

    Stimulus– produces a change to a variable (the factor being regulated).
    Receptor– detects the change. The receptor monitors the environment and responds to change (stimuli).
    Input– information travels along the (afferent) pathway to the control center. The control center determines the appropriate response and course of action.
    Output– information sent from the control center travels down the (efferent) pathway to the effector.
    Response– a response from the effector balances out the original stimulus to maintain homeostasis.

- Population 					/ education 
- Finance 						/ debt as positive feedback

development	
-----------

The development for this site is divided between three parts.
These include mediator technologies, system and user interface, the areas are collectively divided to three github repositories.

- online ontology 	- Wordpress 
- stock 			- Arcgis
- system			- Orange Canvas

The languages used within the project include Python, Java, Java-script, and php.
The solution encompasses everything from acquiring the data to visualizing it as ARCGIS map at browser.

Religion

Alain de Botton

"What aspects of religion should atheists (respectfully) adopt? Alain de Botton suggests a "religion for atheists" -- call it Atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence." Ted

- http://www.ourladyisgod.com/i-FreemasonKJVBible.php

	To me Christianity is a foundation for my believes and history. 
	And yet on ideology I would describe myself as being an atheist. 

	every once in a while I venture into a Church during a mass and listen.
	I like the atmosphere, the customs, and the traditions that the event incorporates. 
	Yet, I disbelieve in the higher power. 
	To me that is outsourcing gone rogue.

	We are responsible individually of our own actions, and thus, we are the ones that have the responsibility to atone for them. 
	To take responsibility, to reconcile and to apologize when necessary.

- Feminism - in Trump we trust

	Definition of feminism - merry-ann Webster
	1. the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes
	2. organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests

Western World

	- https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=feminism

	As a man with Western heritage .... 

	My generation is responsible of the sins of the grandparents in my lineage? <--> Thus, I am responsible to atone those sins that the past generations have made.  

	Towards people of colour, towards the third world, towards Muslims, and now Towards women. I feel these feelings in my daily life;
	I am reminded of them when I follow up on the news-cycle and documentaries; And I understand them through reading and dialogue. 
	
	Over the span of past decades and past generations, the western ideals have become described as universal ideals. 
	Yet as a people with heritage to Europe, North America, and Australia we account around 10 % of the people living on this planet.
	
	The rise of feminism in the Western democracies is an added weight for the list of sins that we now inherit and pass onto our children. 
	
	It is a burden difficult to express.
